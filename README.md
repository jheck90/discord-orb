# Discord Orb

Easily integrate custom [Discord](https://discord.com/ "Discord") notifications into your [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/ "CircleCI") projects. Create custom alert messages for any job or receive status updates.

Learn more about [Orbs](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/using-orbs/ "Using Orbs").

## Usage
Example config:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  discord: jheck90/discord@x.y.z/*

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: <docker image>
    steps:
      - discord/<command>
```

`discord@1.0.0` from the `jheck90` namespace is imported into the config.yml as `discord` and can then be referenced as such in any job or workflow.

## Dependencies / Requirements

### Bash Shell
Because these scripts use bash-specific features, `Bash` is required.
`Bash` is the default shell used on CircleCI and the Orb will be compatible with most images.
If using an `Alpine` base image, you will need to call `apk add bash` before calling this Orb,
or create a derivative base image that calls `RUN apk add bash`.
If `Bash` is not available, an error message will be logged and the task will fail.

### cURL
cURL is used to post the Webhook data and must be installed in the container to function properly.

### What to do with Discord Webhook
You can implement the Webhook in one of two ways, either as an environment variable, or as a parameter.

1. In the settings page for your project on CircleCI, click `Environment Variables`. From that page you can click the `Add Variable` button. Finally, enter your webhook as the value, and `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` as the name.
2. You can enter the Webhook for the individual status or alert by entering it at the `webhook` parameter, as shown above.
